### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I have been developing software since 1976.  I've written in BASIC, Pascal, COBOL, FORTRAN, Assembler (6502/6510), PHP and JavaScript.  I've been a freelance / contract developer for the better part of four decades.  Although the first 20 years of my career were spent as a Radio Frequency Engineer in the wireless telephony industry, I've continued to mature my programming knowledge and experience and since taken on many proects as a professional developer.
